=head1 DESCRIPTION

This middleware is a companion to L<Plack::Middleware::SizeLimit> that
emits a warning when a process is killed.

When it detects that the current process is killed, it will emit a
warning with diagnostic information of the form:

  pid %d committed harakiri (size: %d, shared: %d, unshared: %d) at %s

Note that this middleware must be enabled before plugins that set the
"harakiri" flag.
